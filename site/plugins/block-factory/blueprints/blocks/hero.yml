          You can add a background image or video to your hero. If you add both, the video will take precedence.

          Don't forget to add **alt text**, **image credits**, and/or **set a focal point** for cropping. You can do this by clicking the image above or in the _Files_ section of the sidebar.

          _Must be a **direct link** to a video file, not an embed code._ We recommend hosting your videos on Vimeo, where the "direct video links" are readily available in the settings for each video.
