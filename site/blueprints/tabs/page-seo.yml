    help: Defines the title of the page that appears in search engine results, the browser's title bar, and when the page is bookmarked.
  meta_description:
    label: Meta Description
    type: textarea
    help: Provides a brief summary of a web page. Search engines such as Google often display the meta description in search results, which can influence click-through rates. It's typically up to 160 characters long and should be relevant to the content of the page.
  noindex:
    label: No Index
    type: toggle
    text:
      - "OFF"
      - "ON"
    default: "OFF"
    help: When enabled, this page will not be indexed by search engines, meaning it won't show up in search results.
  nofollow:
    label: No Follow
    type: toggle
    text:
      - "OFF"
      - "ON"
    default: "OFF"
    help: When enabled, this tells search engines not to follow any links on the page for ranking purposes. This means that the search engine's crawler (lookin' at you, Googlebot) will not follow or crawl any links found on the page. This can be useful if you want to prevent search engines from following links to untrusted content or to pages that are irrelevant to your site's ranking.
